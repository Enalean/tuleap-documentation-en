Back end tests
==============

`PHPUnit <https://https://phpunit.de/documentation.html/>`_ is the php testing framework to write down our PHP unit tests.

You must provide some unit tests for any back-end development.

More information for tests in :ref:`unit testing with phpunit<phpunit_test>` section.
