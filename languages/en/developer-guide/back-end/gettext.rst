Gettext
=======

`Gettext system documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>`_

In core
-------

  .. code-block:: php

    echo _('Homepage');

In plugins
----------

We use the *domain* feature provided by gettext in order to have i18n in plugins.

  .. code-block:: php

    echo dgettext('tuleap-proftpd', 'File');

.. NOTE:: The command ``xgettext`` extracts strings without being able to interpret PHP constants or variables. Don't try to be too smart and don't put the domain ``tuleap-proftpd`` in a variable or a constant, we **need** to repeat ourselves.


.. NOTE:: You can use localized strings from core or other plugins (beware of dependencies!) in a given plugin.

Pluralization
-------------

  .. code-block:: php

    echo sprintf(
        dngettext(
            'tuleap-tracker',
            "The field '%s' doesn't exist",
            "The fields '%s' don't exist",
            $nb_nonexistent_fields
        ),
        implode("', '", $nonexistent_fields)
    );
    // The field 'summary' doesn't exist
    // or
    // The fields 'summary', 'details' don't exist

.. NOTE:: Pluralization is only available for plugins as of today.

Workflow
--------

1. Add a new localizable string.
2. Run ``make generate-po``. This will update corresponding .pot files that are templates for your localization files.
3. Edit localization files in ``site-content/fr_FR/LC_MESSAGES/tuleap-xxxx.po`` with your favorite editor (poedit is fine).
4. Once you have localized your sentences, run ``make generate-mo`` (some editors, like poedit, generate .mo files for you).
   You may need to restart your webserver (``docker exec tuleap-web /etc/init.d/rh-php56-php-fpm restart``).
5. Refresh your browser, and voil√†!

.. NOTE:: If you are introducing gettext in a plugin, you must ``touch plugins/<name>/site-content/tuleap-<name>.pot`` and ``mkdir plugins/<name>/site-content/fr_FR`` before calling ``make generate-po``.

  Furthermore you must declare your domain in the constructor of your plugin. For example, for ``tracker`` plugin,
  in ``trackerPlugin.class.php``:

  .. code-block:: php

    bindtextdomain('tuleap-tracker', __DIR__.'/../site-content');


.. IMPORTANT::  On our dev setup (tuleap-aio-dev) you must ensure that "fr_FR" locale is installed (``locale -a``). If it is not the case, run ``localedef -i fr_FR -f UTF-8 fr_FR.UTF-8``.

tab files
---------

This system is based on a key/value pair. PHP code references a key (actually a primary and a secondary keys) which is
replaced by the full sentence, according to the user preferences.

Language files are available in the ``site-content/`` directory, for example ``site-content/en_US/include/include.tab``.
The same file exists for the french version: ``site-content/fr_FR/include/include.tab``.

These language files follow a defined syntax:

  .. code-block:: bash

    key1 [tab] key2 [tab] translated string

and sentences are separated by a carriage return. Keys are split in different files for convenience, but are "compiled"
in a big unique file at execution.

Example:

  .. code-block:: bash

    include_exit	error	An error occured


The class that manages i18n is BaseLanguage (``src/common/language/BaseLanguage.class.php``). It is initialized by
``pre.php``, and language is set according to the user preferences. This php code will return the matching string
defined in language files:

  .. code-block:: php

    $GLOBALS['Language']->getText('include_exit', 'error'));
