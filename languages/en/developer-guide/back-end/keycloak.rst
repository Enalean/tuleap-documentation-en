Keycloak in dev environment
===========================

This section covers how to setup a local OIDC provider based on `Keycloak <https://www.keycloak.org/>`_ next to your
Tuleap development platform in order to develop or debug.

Configure Keycloak server
-------------------------

Start a local Keycloak server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the following to the ``docker-compose.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    keycloak:
      image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:20.0.3
      command: start-dev
      environment:
        - KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin
        - KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin


Then start the container::

  docker-compose up -d keycloak

You will get the keycloak container ip address with::

  make show-ips
  # 172.18.0.11 /tuleap-keycloak-1

Examples below will be based on ``172.18.0.11``. You should adapt them to your own address.

Create a realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open `<http://172.18.0.11:8080>`_ in your browser and open the Administration Console. Admin credentials can be find in
the ``docker-compose.yml`` you updated beforehand.

By default you are on the realm "master", but it is advised to work on your own. So create a new realm, here we will
name it ``tuleap-realm``.

In this realm, we now create a user to verify authentication.

* Create new user

  * Username: ``jdoe``
  * Email: ``jdoe@example.com`` *(or your own)*
  * Email verified: ``On``
  * First name: ``Jane``
  * Last name: ``Doe``

* Set a password in Credentials (Temporary: ``Off``)
* Test the connection

  * Open `<http://172.18.0.11:8080/realms/tuleap-realm/account>`_ in a tab
  * Connect with ``jdoe``.
  * Celebrate your first victory ðŸŽ‰

Create a client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is where we allow Tuleap to use this Keycloak server for authentication.

As administrator, in the realm ``tuleap-realm``, create a Client. We choose ``tuleap-dev`` as ID:

* Client type: ``OpenID Connect``
* Client ID: ``tuleap-dev``
* Client authentication: ``On``

Once created, update the Access settings:

* Valid redirect URIs: ``https://tuleap-web.tuleap-aio-dev.docker/plugins/openidconnectclient/``
* Web origins: ``https://tuleap-web.tuleap-aio-dev.docker/``

Copy the needed informations to create the provider on Tuleap side (see below):

* Client secret is given in the Credentials tab of the server.
* Endpoints are given by the following URL `<http://172.18.0.11:8080/realms/tuleap-realm/.well-known/openid-configuration>`_.

Configure Tuleap to use Keycloak
--------------------------------

As site administrator, install and enable OpenID Connect Client plugin. Now create a provider:

* Name: ``Keycloak``
* Authorization endpoint: ``https://172.18.0.11:8080/realms/tuleap-realm/protocol/openid-connect/auth``
* Token endpoint: ``https://172.18.0.11:8080/realms/tuleap-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token``
* JWKS endpoint: ``https://172.18.0.11:8080/realms/tuleap-realm/protocol/openid-connect/certs``
* User information endpoint: ``https://172.18.0.11:8080/realms/tuleap-realm/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo``
* Client ID: ``tuleap-dev``
* Client secret: ``<client-id>``

.. NOTE:: Tuleap asks us to enter valid ``https`` URLs. Since we are in a dev environment and we didn't set up
  certificates for SSL we have to create the provider with ``https`` URLs first and then update by hand the table
  ``plugin_openidconnectclient_provider_generic`` to switch to ``http`` URLs.

As anonymous go to login page and use the ``Keycloak`` button. Connect to Keycloak by using ``jdoe`` account you
configured earlier. You should be redirected to Tuleap and be able to link an account to OpenID Connect.

Celebrate your great success ðŸŽ‰, you deserve it.
