Integration with Web UI
=======================

Tuleap provides plenty of :ref:`REST APIs <rest_api>` for most services. This is useful when the integration is done
with an external system (VSCode, etc). But when one need to render something inside Tuleap UI, REST is not enough.

Tuleap SideBar
--------------

You can get a WebApp very close to Tuleap rendering thanks to `Tuleap SideBar WebComponent <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tuleap/project-sidebar>`_.
