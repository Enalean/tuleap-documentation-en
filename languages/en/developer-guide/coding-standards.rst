Tuleap coding standards
=======================

As Tuleap is mainly written in PHP, we use the PSR standards:

* PSR-1 http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/
* PSR-2 http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/

Indenting and Line Length
--------------------------

Use an indent of 4 spaces, with no tabs. This helps to avoid problems with diffs, patches, git history ...

It is recommended to keep lines at approximately 85-100 characters long for better code readability.
