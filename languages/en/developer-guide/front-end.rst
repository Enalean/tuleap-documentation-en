Front End
=========

Tuleap front end can be divided in two worlds

- Mostly static pages that are rendered server side using mustache templating (with some vanilia JS for simple interactions).
- Rich, dynamic, pages that are rendered client side using Vuejs.

Front end build system is based on webpack.

Historically you will also find

- AngularJS 1.X code.
- JQuery code.
- Prototype / Scriptaculous code.
- Good old php3&4/mysql scripts where DB, HTML and JS are mixed.
