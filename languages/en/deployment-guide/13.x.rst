.. NOTE::

  Tuleap 13.2 is currently under development.


Nothing to mention.

Tuleap 13.1
===========

Minimal browser support raised to Firefox 78 ESR and Chrome 87
--------------------------------------------------------------

The best effort support is now Firefox 78 ESR and Chrome 87. Versions
older than that do not work at all anymore to browse Tuleap.

:ref:`The recommendation is still to use the latest version of Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge
or Google Chrome <user_supported_browsers>`.

Tuleap can no longer be accessed with http without TLS (HTTPS only)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuleap always expects to be accessed over HTTPS, for this reason having a dedicated
setting ``sys_https_host`` is no more necessary.

You should make sure the setting ``sys_default_domain`` in your
``/etc/tuleap/conf/local.inc`` file is set to the qualified domain
name you use to access the instance.

The setting ``sys_https_host`` can be removed from your
``/etc/tuleap/conf/local.inc`` file as it is no more used.

Plugin configuration can no longer be edited from Tuleap Site Administrator UI
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's been deprecated and deactivated by default since :ref:`Tuleap 9.8 <deployment_guide_9_8>`, released in may 2017. So
hopefully nobody still have this activated and used. Before Tuleap 9.8, plugin variables defined in ``/etc/tuleap/plugin/$PLUGIN/etc/$PLUGIN.inc``
file were editable from site administration interface.

This was a major security risk (allow users to write code that will be executed is always a major risk) so we deactivated
it by default for all platforms and introduced a parameter in ``local.inc`` to allow admins to do a smooth transition.

In case of doubt, check if ``/etc/tuleap/conf/local.inc`` contains a variable named ``$sys_plugins_editable_configuration``:


* If it is set to ``0``. If it's the case, you're good, you can remove this variable, it's no longer used.
* If it is set to ``1``. You were at risk and you are now safer.

For teams that were still ``$sys_plugins_editable_configuration = 1;`` it means that update of the configuration must now
be done with an SSH access to the platform.
