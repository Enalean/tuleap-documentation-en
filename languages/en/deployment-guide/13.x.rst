Tuleap 13.1
===========

.. NOTE::

  Tuleap 13.1 is currently under development.

Minimal browser support raised to Firefox 78 ESR and Chrome 87
--------------------------------------------------------------

The best effort support is now Firefox 78 ESR and Chrome 87. Versions
older than that do not work at all anymore to browse Tuleap.

:ref:`The recommendation is still to use the latest version of Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge
or Google Chrome <user_supported_browsers>`.

Tuleap can no longer be accessed with http without TLS (HTTPS only)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuleap always expects to be accessed over HTTPS, for this reason having a dedicated
setting ``sys_https_host`` is no more necessary.

You should make sure the setting ``sys_default_domain`` in your
``/etc/tuleap/conf/local.inc`` file is set to the qualified domain
name you use to access the instance.

The setting ``sys_https_host`` can be removed from your
``/etc/tuleap/conf/local.inc`` file as it is no more used.


Tuleap 13.0
===========

Nothing to mention.
