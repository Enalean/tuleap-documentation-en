Tuleap 12.0
===========

.. NOTE::

  Tuleap 12.0 is currently under development.

CVS modifications
-----------------

We made a lot of changes for CVS in the packaging and in the backend of this service.
If you are still using it, after upgrading to 12.0, you have to run the following commands:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    find /cvsroot/*/CVSROOT -name "loginfo" -exec sed -i "s#ALL /usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum#ALL sudo -u codendiadm -E /usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum#" {} \;
    find /cvsroot/*/CVSROOT -name "loginfo" -exec sed -r -i "s#ALL \(/usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum (.*)\)#ALL sudo -u codendiadm -E /usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum \1#" {} \;
    tuleap queue-system-check

The queue system check command will recreate the CVS locks. These CVS repositories will be usable once the system check is done.  

OpenID Connect
--------------

.. attention::

    Existing accounts that already connected to an OpenID Connect provider will no longer be allowed to authenticate with
    their local Tuleap credentials.

    This impacts users for:

    * Web login (they should use OpenID Connect instead)
    * REST API access (they should use :ref:`Access Keys <access-keys>`.)
    * Git over https access (they should use :ref:`Access Keys <access-keys>`.)
    * Subversion access (they should use :ref:`SVN Tokens <svn-plugin-use-token>`.)

    Access to **SOAP API is no longer possible** for users that switch to OpenID Connect.
