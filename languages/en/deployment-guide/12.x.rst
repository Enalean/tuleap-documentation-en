Tuleap 12.x
###########

Tuleap 12.6
===========

User lab mode has been removed
------------------------------

The user lab mode was only used to enable the "Scrum v2"/"scrum mono-milestone" feature.
This feature can now be made visible on the whole platform by executing on the instance:

.. sourcecode:: shell

        tuleap config-set feature_flag_allow_scrum_mono_milestone_usage 1

Tuleap 12.5
===========

Setting ``sys_async_emails`` is no more used
--------------------------------------------

Tracker notifications are now always sent asynchronously as soon as Tuleap detects :ref:`backend workers<admin_howto_backend_worker>`.
You can safely remove this setting from your ``/etc/tuleap/conf/local.inc`` file.

Tuleap 12.4
===========

End of support of Internet Explorer
-----------------------------------

Tuleap does not support Internet Explorer anymore. Users of Internet Explorer
must migrate to a :ref:`supported modern alternative <user_supported_browsers>`.

WebDAV
------

Regardless of the configuration you've done on webdav plugin (dedicated host & path), as soon as webdav plugin is active
the webdav service will be accessible on the ``/plugins/webdav`` path on the ``$sys_https_host`` configured in ``local.inc``.
That is to say, if you access Tuleap with ``https://tuleap.example.com``, then webdav will be accessible on ``https://tuleap.example.com/plugins/webdav``.

The access via a dedicated host (like ``https://webdav.tuleap.example.com/``) that was once necessary for windows 7 and
before support, is deprecated and should no longer be used. It still works but might be removed as it simplifies the nginx
& DNS configurations so less trouble for administrators.

.. _remove_permissions_overrider:

Permissions Overrider deprecated
--------------------------------

If you previously deployed a ``/etc/tuleap/local_glue/PermissionsOverrider.php`` this feature is now deprecated and will
be removed end of March 2021. There is no replacement for the feature as it brings more security risk and maintenance burden
than functional advantage.

Tuleap 12.3
===========

End of support of CentOS/RHEL 6
-------------------------------

CentOS/RHEL 6 is no more supported (security fix included).
Tuleap packages for this version are not available anymore.
Instances must be migrated to CentOS/RHEL 7.


``server_tokens`` nginx setting is now set by default
-----------------------------------------------------

Tuleap now sets the setting ``server_tokens`` to off by default.
If you have customized your nginx configuration to explicitly set
``server_tokens``, you will need to remove this customization.

Tuleap 12.2
===========

MOTD becomes Platform banner
----------------------------

When you had to display a message to all users, you were used to edit
file ``/etc/tuleap/site-content/en_US/others/motd.txt``. Now you have to use
the :ref:`Web interface <platform-banner>` instead
(former files are not taken into account anymore,
you can delete them). This will bring a more integrated experience
than the old way. See `story #14670 <https://tuleap.net/plugins/tracker/?aid=14670>`_
for more details.

.. _svn_core_to_plugin:

Subversion Core active deprecation
----------------------------------

The migration from Subversion Core (legacy `Subversion` service) to `SVN` plugin intensify with banner display to encourage
the switch to plugin. Subversion administrator can initiate the migration on there own with the web UI. System administrator
still have access to the CLI tool ``/usr/share/tuleap/src/utils/php-launcher.sh /usr/share/tuleap/plugins/svn/bin/migrate_to_plugin.php``

The migration is done "In Place" that is to say that data won't be touched and URLs remains the same.
Settings are migrated (iso-functional) but the new hooks are deployed. Theoretically nothing should change for end user
(except email format).

The documentation of Subversion Core has been removed. The Subversion Core features that have no equivalent in plugin
are disabled (SVN Widgets, SVN Query & My SVN Commits). Data remains, in case of big trouble there is a (temporary) way
back (contact the dev team).

In case of trouble the migration can be reverted with administrative actions:

First, on database side:

.. sourcecode:: sql

        DELETE FROM plugin_svn_repositories WHERE project_id = PROJECT_ID and is_core = 1;

Then, in the repository on file system (``/var/lib/tuleap/svnroot/PROJECT_NAME/hooks``) as ``root``:

.. sourcecode:: shell

        /bin/rm -f post-commit post-revprop-change pre-commit pre-revprop-change
        tuleap queue-system-check
        tuleap process-system-events default

If you have to revert, please contact the dev team to explain the issue

Tuleap 12.1
===========

Mandatory changes for Subversion (core and plugin)
--------------------------------------------------

This is the continuation of the work initiated in Tuleap 12.0: accounts connected to an OpenID Connect provider must
use :ref:`SVN Tokens <svn-plugin-use-token>` to access SVN repositories.

In order to enforce this change, it is necessary to allow the DB user used to handle SVN authentications more access to the
database. **These changes are mandatory even if your Tuleap instance does not use the OpenID Connect plugin.**
You must run the following commands on your database with a privileged user:

.. sourcecode:: sql

        GRANT CREATE,SELECT ON plugin_ldap_user TO dbauthuser;
        GRANT CREATE,SELECT ON plugin_openidconnectclient_user_mapping TO dbauthuser;
        REVOKE CREATE ON plugin_ldap_user FROM dbauthuser;
        REVOKE CREATE ON plugin_openidconnectclient_user_mapping FROM dbauthuser;
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Tuleap 12.0
===========

LDAP and Active directory configuration
---------------------------------------

We have added a new optional configuration variable in ``/etc/tuleap/plugins/ldap/etc/ldap.inc``:

``$sys_ldap_server_common_name``: This value is used in Tuleap screens to refer to the server like ``Enter your $sys_ldap_server_common_name credentials``.
It defines how people refer to the Active Directory server, most of the time it's "Active Directory" but it can be "LDAP" or "Enterprise Directory".
When it is not defined, its default value will be "LDAP".

Organization logo
-----------------

We changed the way the organization logo is displayed. The default logo
is now in SVG format. We encourage you to read the
:ref:`organization logo documentation <organization-logo>`
to know if you must adjust you existing logo.

TL;DR: your existing organization logo might appear broken.

CVS modifications
-----------------

We made a lot of changes for CVS in the packaging and in the backend of this service.
If you are still using it, after upgrading to 12.0, you have to run the following commands:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    find /cvsroot/*/CVSROOT -name "loginfo" -exec sed -i "s#ALL /usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum#ALL sudo -u codendiadm -E /usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum#" {} \;
    find /cvsroot/*/CVSROOT -name "loginfo" -exec sed -r -i "s#ALL \(/usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum (.*)\)#ALL sudo -u codendiadm -E /usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum \1#" {} \;
    tuleap queue-system-check

The queue system check command will recreate the CVS locks. These CVS repositories will be usable once the system check is done.

OpenID Connect
--------------

.. attention::

    Existing accounts that already connected to an OpenID Connect provider will no longer be allowed to authenticate with
    their local Tuleap credentials.

    This impacts users for:

    * Web login (they should use OpenID Connect instead)
    * REST API access (they should use :ref:`Access Keys <access-keys>`.)
    * Git over https access (they should use :ref:`Access Keys <access-keys>`.)
    * Subversion access (they should use :ref:`SVN Tokens <svn-plugin-use-token>`.)

    Access to **SOAP API is no longer possible** for users that switch to OpenID Connect.
