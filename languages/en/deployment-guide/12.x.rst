Tuleap 12.0
===========

.. NOTE::

  Tuleap 12.0 is currently under development.

CVS modifications
-----------------

We made a lot of changes for CVS in the packaging and in the backend of this service.
If you are still using it, after upgrading to 12.0, you have to run the following commands:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    find /cvsroot/*/CVSROOT -name "loginfo" -exec sed -i "s#ALL /usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum#ALL sudo -u codendiadm -E /usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum#" {} \;
    find /cvsroot/*/CVSROOT -name "loginfo" -exec sed -r -i "s#ALL \(/usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum (.*)\)#ALL sudo -u codendiadm -E /usr/lib/tuleap/bin/log_accum \1#" {} \;
    tuleap queue-system-check

The queue system check command will recreate the CVS locks. These CVS reprositories will be usable once the system check is done.
