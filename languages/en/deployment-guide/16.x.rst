Tuleap 16.4 - January 2025
==========================


API BREAKING CHANGE:
--------------------

``/api/cross_tracker_reports/{id}/content`` and ``/api/cross_tracker_reports/{id}`` REST endpoint changed. The optional parameter ``report_mode`` is removed.
All reports are now in mode expert and thus this parameter is no longer needed. All default report are migrated to expert mode.

Git configuration
-----------------

Git configuration options are automatically transferred to database. The following variables are impacted:

- ``git_backup_dir``
- ``weeks_number``

Other git configuration options were already in the database, you can find all configuration options with ``tuleap config-list``.

Before 16.4, configuration variables were defined in ``/etc/tuleap/plugins/git/etc/config.inc``, the upgrade process will rename
the file automatically (with ``tuleapsave`` and a timestamp). You can review and delete the file to avoid confusions in the future.
