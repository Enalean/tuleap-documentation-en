Removal of remaining dependencies to PHP 8.1 packages
-----------------------------------------------------

The remaining dependencies to PHP 8.1 packages have been removed.
After the upgrade you can remove the packages from your system.

On Rocky Linux 9:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    dnf remove php81\*

On CentOS/RHEL 7:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    yum remove php81\*

Tuleap 15.5
===========

End of support of PHP 8.1
-------------------------

Tuleap now comes with PHP 8.2.

PHP FPM configuration will be deployed automatically by ``tuleap-cfg site-deploy``.

If you have made some tweaks to the configuration file
``/etc/opt/remi/php81/php-fpm.d/tuleap.conf`` you will also needs
to adapt them for the new configuration at ``/etc/opt/remi/php82/php-fpm.d/tuleap.conf``.

``$sys_nb_backend_workers`` removed from ``local.inc``
------------------------------------------------------

The configuration variable ``$sys_nb_backend_workers``,
used for asynchronous job processing (see :ref:`backend workers guide<installation_redis>`),
is now set via ``tuleap config-set``.

It is recommended to remove it from ``/etc/tuleap/conf/local.inc``. If you had set it specifically
to a value greater than 2, you can keep your settings by issuing the following command:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    tuleap config-set sys_nb_backend_workers <NB>

New plugin: Tuleap Functions for Tracker
----------------------------------------

This plugin is only available for :ref:`Tuleap Entreprise <tuleap-enterprise>`.

:ref:`Tuleap Functions for Tracker <tracker-functions>` execute custom code after each artifact creation/update.

How to install:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    yum install tuleap-plugin-tracker-functions
    sudo -u codendiadm tuleap plugin:install tracker_functions
    tuleap-cfg site-deploy
    systemctl reload nginx
    systemctl restart tuleap

Tuleap 15.2
===========

End of support of MySQL 5.7
---------------------------

MySQL 5.7 has reached its end of life and therefore is not supported by Tuleap anymore.
You must upgrade to MySQL 8.0.

You can report to :ref:`the upgrade guide for more information <mysql80_upgrade>`.

Tuleap 15.1
===========

Nothing to mention.

Tuleap 15.0
===========

Removal of the support of ForumML, CVS and of the management of system users and groups
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The features related to the ForumML plugin, CVS and the management of system users and
groups have been removed from Tuleap.

We recommend that you remove the package dependencies that were associated to these features:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    yum remove cvs-tuleap mailman-tuleap libnss-mysql

If you were relying on the management of system users and groups by Tuleap you will need
to manage those users manually and you should also remove any mention of ``mysql`` in the
``/etc/nsswitch.conf`` configuration file.
