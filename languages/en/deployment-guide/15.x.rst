Removal of the support of ForumML, CVS and of the management of system users and groups
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The features related to the ForumML plugin, CVS and the management of system users and
groups have been removed from Tuleap.

We recommend that you remove the package dependencies that were associated to these features:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    yum remove cvs-tuleap mailman-tuleap libnss-mysql

If you were relying on the management of system users and groups by Tuleap you will need
to manage those users manually and you should also remove any mention of ``mysql`` in the
``/etc/nsswitch.conf`` configuration file.
