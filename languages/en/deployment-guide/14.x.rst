===========

.. NOTE::

Nothing to mention.

Tuleap 14.2

With the removal of the "good old" ``tuleap.pm`` that was used to control the access to subversion repositories, 
you should force the re-generation of the apache configuration before the start of the stack.

You can play the following snippet before running the :ref:`regular upgrade <update>`

.. sourcecode:: shell

    rm -f /etc/httpd/conf.d/tuleap-svnroot.conf
    tuleap queue-system-check
    tuleap process-system-events default
