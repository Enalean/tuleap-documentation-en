Default protection against Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Tuleap now comes with a protection against `Server Side Request Forgery <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery>`_.
This protection is active by default if you have not defined a custom ``sys_proxy`` setting.

Any outbound requests Tuleap send (e.g. webhooks, imports from JIRA, RSS widgetâ€¦) are now rejected if they try to access
a service on a :ref:`non public network <ssrf_default_filters>`.

You can find more information on what is exactly filtered and how to add exceptions to the filters in :ref:`the dedicated documentation section <ssrf_protection>`.

Tuleap 14.7
===========

Automatic deployment of Tuleap Realtime
---------------------------------------

The Tuleap Realtime service is now automatically deployed and managed by Tuleap.
The Tuleap Realtime service now listen on ``localhost`` and is accessed via the same
endpoint than the rest of the web UI.

If you had customized the ``nginx`` configuration to make it work in your situation you should remove
your customizations to avoid potential conflicts.

Tuleap 14.6
===========

Upgrade of the local Meilisearch instance from 0.35.0 to 1.0.0

This upgrade requires to "update" the Meilisearch database to the `new 1.0.0 version <https://blog.meilisearch.com/v1-enterprise-ready-stable/>`_ ðŸŽ‰.

In order to do that, drop all the existing data and then ask Tuleap to re-index everything after you have upgraded the packages:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    systemctl stop tuleap
    rm -rf /var/lib/tuleap/fts_meilisearch_server/data.ms/
    systemctl start tuleap
    tuleap full-text-search:identify-all-items-to-index
    tuleap full-text-search:index-all-pending-items

    yum remove php80\*

On Rocky Linux 9:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    dnf remove php80\*

Tuleap 14.5
===========

End of support of PHP 8.0

``/etc/opt/remi/php80/php-fpm.d/tuleap.conf`` you will also needs
to adapt them for the new configuration at ``/etc/opt/remi/php81/php-fpm.d/tuleap.conf``.

MySQL 8.0 support and upgrade
-----------------------------

Tuleap 14.4
===========

Removal of the legacy ForgeUpgrade compatibility layer
------------------------------------------------------

:ref:`Update script/procedures <update>` must no longer use ``/usr/lib/forgeupgrade/bin/forgeupgrade``,

===========

Upgrade of the local Meilisearch instance from 0.29.0 to 0.30.0
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is only a concern for you if you have deployed a :ref:`local Meilisearch instance <fts-local-meilisearch>`.

This upgrade requires to "update" the Meilisearch database to the new version.

In order to do that, drop all the existing data and then ask Tuleap to re-index everything after you have upgraded the packages:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    rm -rf /var/lib/tuleap/fts_meilisearch_server/data.ms/
    tuleap full-text-search:identify-all-items-to-index
    tuleap full-text-search:index-all-pending-items

Tuleap 14.2
===========

With the removal of the "good old" ``tuleap.pm`` that was used to control the access to subversion repositories, 
you should force the re-generation of the apache configuration before the start of the stack.

You can play the following snippet before running the :ref:`regular upgrade <update>`

.. sourcecode:: shell

    rm -f /etc/httpd/conf.d/tuleap-svnroot.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/svnroot.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/codendi_svnroot.conf
    tuleap queue-system-check
    tuleap process-system-events default

Some of the files that are listed in the ``rm`` command might not exist on your platform, that's normal.
