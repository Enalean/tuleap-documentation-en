Tuleap 14.3
===========

.. NOTE::

  Tuleap 14.3 is currently under development.


Upgrade of the local Meilisearch instance from 0.29.0 to 0.30.0
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is only a concern for you if you have deployed a :ref:`local Meilisearch instance <fts-local-meilisearch>`.

This upgrade requires to "update" the Meilisearch database to the new version.

In order to do that, drop all the existing data and then ask Tuleap to re-index everything after you have upgraded the packages:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    rm -rf /var/lib/tuleap/fts_meilisearch_server/data.ms/
    tuleap full-text-search:identify-all-items-to-index
    tuleap full-text-search:index-all-pending-items

Tuleap 14.2
===========

With the removal of the "good old" ``tuleap.pm`` that was used to control the access to subversion repositories, 
you should force the re-generation of the apache configuration before the start of the stack.

You can play the following snippet before running the :ref:`regular upgrade <update>`

.. sourcecode:: shell

    rm -f /etc/httpd/conf.d/tuleap-svnroot.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/svnroot.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/codendi_svnroot.conf
    tuleap queue-system-check
    tuleap process-system-events default

Some of the files that are listed in the ``rm`` command might not exist on your platform, that's normal.

Tuleap 14.1
===========

There is one new plugin available for install:

- :ref:`tuleap-plugin-fts-meilisearch <full-text-search-admin>`

Tuleap 14.0
===========

There are two new plugins available for install:

- :ref:`tuleap-plugin-fts-db <full-text-search-admin>`
- :ref:`tuleap-plugin-onlyoffice <onlyoffice-integration>`
