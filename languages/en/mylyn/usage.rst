can force the verification to ensure that your credentials are valid. Do
not forget to make sure that the connector will remember your password
by checking the associated checkbox.

a query in order to retrieve your tasks from the Tuleap server. You can
use the new Query wizard in order to create your query.

ones or queries saved on the server. In your Tuleap project, you may
have created reports in order to vizualize a specific set of tasks
matching a set of critera, you can execute those reports directly from
the Mylyn Connector for Tuleap. you can also define new queries directly
in Eclipse.
