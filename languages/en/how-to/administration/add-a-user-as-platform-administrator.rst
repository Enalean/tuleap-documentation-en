1. As a platform administrator, click the two red wheels icon at the top right of your screen.
2. Go to the ``Permission delegation`` entry in the left sidebar, under the ``Users`` section.
3. Check if you already have an ``Admin`` group. If not:
    1. Create one by clicking on the ``Add group`` button.
    2. Add the ``Platform administration`` permission by clicking the ``Add permissions`` button.
4. On the right part of the screen, use the ``Add user`` field to add one of your users to the ``Admin`` group.
5. The selected user should now also be a Platform Administrator and see the two red wheels icon at the top right of their screen.
