Modification page help
======================

In the bottom right of your tuleap page. You have a star or a question mark depending of the version that you are using.
This page can be modified. For example, to put a link to ask a question to your support team.

To do so you need to go to ``/etc/tuleap/site-content/your_language/help``.
Replace ``your_language`` by ``en_US`` or ``fr_FR`` or ``br_BR`` depending on the using language.

Now you can edit the file ``site.txt``as wish.
