``````````````````````````````````````````````````

You can link a Tuleap item to a Bugzilla reference.


Declare reference
-----------------
First as a platform administrator you should add the keyword you want to use
and the Bugzilla server you want to be linked on.

.. figure:: ../images/screenshots/sc_bugzillaserver.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Add reference and Bugzilla server informations
    :name: Add reference and Bugzilla server informations

Use reference
-------------
Now you can use the new reference in Tuleap and you will see link in both Tuleap and Bugzilla.

.. figure:: ../images/screenshots/sc_tuleap-bugzilla.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Reference in Tuleap
    :name: Reference in Tuleap

.. figure:: ../images/screenshots/sc_bugzilla-tuleap.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Reference in Bugzilla
    :name: Reference in Bugzilla
