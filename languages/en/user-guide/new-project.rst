Creating a New Project
======================

So - you are a freshly registered Tuleap user and you want
to make your developer or project leader life easier. In other words you
want to:

-  Avoid the pain and cost of creating your own project infrastructure
   (with servers and backup)

-  Avoid paying a premium price for commercial version control, defect
   tracking and task management tools

-  Quickly setup a project environment that you can share with your
   colleagues, your partners, your contractors or your customers where
   ever they are while keeping your information safe and under control.

-  Make your organization globally more productive and efficient by
   possibly letting others re-use your software and build on it.

If any of these points is appealing to you then you should definitely
host your software project on Tuleap. Let's see how you can
do that.

.. _project-registration:

Project Registration
--------------------

Before you create a new project you must be a registered user (see :ref:`classes-of-citizens`).
You then login and select the item "Register New Project" in the upper
part of the Tuleap Main Menu.

The project registration is an easy process:

-  **Project Registration**

   Some information about Tuleap Services. Just read it.

   Do not forget to read and agree the Terms of Services Agreement.

-  **Project Name**

   Give the project short name and the project full name. Carefully read
   the restrictions that apply to both names before you type anything.
   The full name can be changed at any time in the life of the project.
   The short name cannot [#f1]_. So think about it twice before you make a
   decision!

-  **Project Template**

   You already registered a Tuleap project and would now
   like to reuse the same configuration (services, trackers, documents,
   references, ...) ? Make your old project a template project (see :ref:`project-type`)
   and you will find it here in the list of available project templates.
   Check your old project as template and your new registered project
   will be staffed as you are used to. If you don't want to reuse a
   specific template just keep the Default Tuleap Template
   checked and go on.

-  **Project Description**

   This is where the rubber hits the road! Tell us about your project.
   Give an accurate description. This is really important if you want to
   maximize the chance of re-use by others. Also list any information
   related to Intellectual Property like Invention Proposal or Patents
   related to the software whether pending or already filed. Give the
   list of software needed (whether internal or 3rd party) to make your
   own software run properly. And the last field is entirely for you.
   Write down all the things that you consider as crucial for your
   project or for the community of users.

-  **Project Services**

   You can choose which services will be activated for your project.
   Please note that you will be able to change those preferences after
   project creation.

-  **Project Categorization**

   Please select up to three classifications for this project in each of
   the Trove root categories. This will help potential developers and
   users to find your project and engage. If the project does not
   require any or all of these classification, simply select "None
   Selected". If you used a project template that had already been
   classified you will find its categories already selected here. You
   can change the trove categories for this project at any time. You can
   categorize your project according to the seven criteria listed in :ref:`software-map-(or Project Tree)`.

-  **Software Policy**

   Most of the time the only valid choice here is the default one:
   "SYS\_ORG\_NAME Code eXchange Policy". As explained earlier in this
   document the Tuleap Team assisted by SYS\_ORG\_NAME
   lawyers have carefully crafted the Tuleap Policy and it
   is very unlikely that you need to create your own. If you do you'll
   have to talk to us and to the SYS\_ORG\_NAME Legal Department to
   validate it. A number of truly Open Source licenses are also
   mentioned in the list. Finally you can also choose you own licensing
   conditions.

-  **Final Confirmation**

   Last chance to review the submitted information before you send it to
   the Tuleap Team for validation. Don't worry: the project
   members can later update all pieces of information shown on this
   page.

After you validate the project registration, the Tuleap Team
reviews the information you submitted and decides to approve it or not.
This process can take up to 24 hours but in most cases it's less than a
couple of hours. So far all projects have been accepted so there is
little to fear ... Shortly after the Tuleap Team approval
you'll receive an e-mail summarizing the characteristics of your project
including a pointer to your new "Project Dashboard" page. Bookmark it in
a safe place!

Post-Registration Configuration
--------------------------------

The first thing to do after you receive the confirmation for your
project registration is to visit the "Project Dashboard" page (URL
included in the e-mail) and finish the configuration of your project.
The 2 following actions are the most frequent ones that have to be taken
after a project is registered:

-  **Categorize your project in the Software Map**

   If you haven't done it during the project registration process, you
   should do it now! Your project categorization appears on your
   "Project Dashboard" page. To categorize your project select the
   "categorize it now" link and fill out the category form fields.

-  **Build the project team**

   Once a project is created, the creator is assigned the role of
   project administrator on this project. It is her responsibility to
   define who are the project members and what their permissions are.
   This can be done by accessing the "Project Admin" page, typing the
   names of all the registered users promote as team members and then
   define their permissions.

    **Tip**

    Rather than putting in place a heavy hierarchy of project topics and
    sub-topics, the Tuleap Team has decided to start small
    and create only a handful of top-level topics in the hierarchy. As
    time goes and as more and more projects register on
    Tuleap we'll refine the hierarchy. If you cannot find
    the appropriate topic for your project, please contact us through
    the "Contact Us" link in the Tuleap Main Menu or submit
    a request in the appropriate Discussion Forum.

.. [#f1]
   Actually it can but you have to ask the Tuleap Team to do
   it for you.
