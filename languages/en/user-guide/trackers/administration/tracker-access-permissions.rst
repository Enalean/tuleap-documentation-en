Default Tracker Access Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the class of citizen a user belongs to and the level of
permissions granted as a project member, the various features of the
Tuleap Tracker may or may not be accessible. Please note
that the default access permissions listed below may change for a
particular tracker if the tracker administrator modifies the access
permission settings. For more information on how to configure tracker
access permissions (see :ref:`tracker-permissions`).
Default permission settings are summarized in
