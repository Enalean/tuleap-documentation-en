Canned Responses
================

One frequently sees project members in charge of the artifact
classification and dispatch process posting the same follow-up comments
repeatedly. Typical examples of repeated posted comments are: a thank
you message to the originator, a request for the originator to provide
commonly missing information like version numbers or type of machine
used, etc. (see `Definition of Canned Responses`_)

Rather than repeatedly typing the same follow-up comments,
Tuleap allows project members to create a predefined set of
responses. After these canned responses have been defined, posting a
follow-up comment is just a matter of selecting the appropriate response
from the pull down menu in the artifact update form.
