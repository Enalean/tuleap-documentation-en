General Configuration Settings
==============================

This module allows you to define a series of properties for your
tracker. Some of those properties have already been defined in the
tracker creation form while some others are only available on this
configuration page. The properties are as follows:

-  **Name**: this is the name of your tracker. More precisely you want
   to name your tracker after the type of artifact that are going to be
   managed in your tracker. This name will be used by Tuleap
   in the title of the various screens of the trackers. Typical example
   of tracker names are: Action Requests, Support Requests,
   Requirements, Defects or Bugs…

-  **Description**: A longer description of what this tracker is all
   about and the type of artifact that it manages.

-  **Short name**: this is a short name that best describe the type of
   artifact managed in this tracker. This name must be quite short as it
   is used in various screens of the Tuleap Tracker like the
   artifact update form next to the artifact ID. Following the examples
   given for the Name field above, short names can be: AR for Action
   Request, SR for Support Requests, Reqt for Requirements, bug for
   Bugs…

-  **Instantiate for new projects**: This parameter is only displayed
   when working on a "template" type of project (see :ref:`project-type`). If the
   parameter is selected, then projects created from this template
   project will have this tracker created. If not selected, the tracker
   will not be available in the new project.

-  **Submit instructions**: an introductory message that displays at the
   top of the artifact submission form. This is a convenient way to give
   directions and recommendations to the submitter. The text must use
   HTML tags for formatting which gives a great flexibility to shape the
   content of this preamble (you can use bold, italic, colors, embedded
   URL…)

-  **Browse instructions**: an introductory message that displays at the
   top of the artifact searching and browsing screen. The text must use
   HTML tags for formatting which gives a great flexibility to shape the
   content of this preamble (you can use bold, italic, colors, embedded
   URL…)
