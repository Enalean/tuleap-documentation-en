Tracker Structure Export
========================

Tuleap allows you to export the structure of the trackers
into an XML file. The Tuleap tracker templates are provided
under the form of such XML files. This feature is also really convenient
to copy a tracker from a Tuleap server to another.

To export the structure of your tracker, please go to the admin part of
your tracker, and select the Export link. This will open a browser
window to choose the location of the exported file.

The exported structure file can be used when you create a new tracker.

.. NOTE::

    This does not copy the artifacts of the tracker but only the
    structure (general settings, fields, values, workflow, semantic, canned responses and permissions).
