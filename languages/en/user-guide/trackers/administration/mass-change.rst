Artifact Mass Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tracker admins have the ability to update many artifacts at once. This
feature can be convenient to assign all bugs or tasks of a team member
to another if the person is moving on another project for instance.

To do this, select the "mass change" link in the "options" menu of the
tracker report. Please note that only tracker admins have access to that
option.

You will be able to update any kind of field (except the semantic title
field). Number of artifacts to be updated are displayed with their
artifact Ids. By default, all fields have the "value" set to
"unchanged". If you don't want to update a field, please keep the value
unchanged. To update a field for every artifacts, just update it. You
can also add a follow-up comment.

.. NOTE::

   The artifact mass change feature allows to by-pass any workflow on field(s)
