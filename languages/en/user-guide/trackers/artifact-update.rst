Artifact Update
---------------

Selecting an artifact from the list generated by a search operation will
bring you to a screen with all the artifact details. Depending on the
permissions you have on this tracker, the detailed view is made
of text fields and menus that you can update with new values. If you are
an anonymous user or a registered user who does not belong to the
project team, most of the fields will likely appear as immutable text.
By default, non-project members cannot edit any of the artifact fields.
They can only submit a follow-up comment.

The Artifact Update screen is divided in several parts: **Header and
Comments.**

Header
~~~~~~

The header zone is where you'll find all the fields associated with an
artifact. Many of these fields are assigned a set of
predefined values (Status, Category, Resolution) while some others have
a number format (Effort) or a free text format (Summary). For more
clarity, the fields are grouped in field sets. The set of fields used in
a given tracker, as well as the related set of predefined values and the
field sets can be configured by project members who have administration
permissions on this tracker.

Dynamic Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some fields have a particular behaviour and some explanations seem
necessary.

-  **Automatically edit fields**: Tuleap includes fields
   that are automatically set : "Artifact ID", "Last Update Date",
   "Submitted By", "Submitted On" and "Rank". The users can't edit that fields.

-  **Cross-Reference**: Tuleap offers another dynamic field
   which has the ability to cross-reference any artifact, or any other
   Tuleap object from within a follow-up comment.

   When typing a follow-up comment, any text that follows the pattern
   "XXX #NNN" will be interpreted as a reference to the artifact XXX
   number NNN, where NNN is the unique artifact ID, and XXX is the
   tracker short name (e.g. "bug #123", "task #321", "req #12", etc.).
   If you don't know the tracker short name or don't want to specify it,
   you may simply use "art #NNN". Each time Tuleap displays
   a piece of text that follows this pattern it will auto-magically
   create an hyperlink to the web page showing all the details of the
   artifact.

   Tuleap reference patterns may be used to reference
   artifacts, as well as source code commits, documents, files, etc.
   Please refer to :ref:`reference-overview` for more details on References.

   Furthemore references concerning artifacts, svn revisions and cvs
   commits are stored in the database. They are displayed in the next
   section, ordered by type and initial reference direction.

Comments
````````

As many follow-up comments as needed can be attached to any given
artifact. Follow-up comments are free text fields where virtually any
kind of information or comment can be typed in.

Follow-up comments have several of interesting capabilities and
extensions:

-  **Changeset**: Each follow-up comment has a part dedicated to the
   artifact history. This keeps track of all changes that occurred on
   all artifact fields since the creation of the artifact. The artifact
   history shows what fields changed, what the old value was befor the
   change took place, who changed it and when.

-  **Canned Responses**: it is not infrequent to see the project members
   in charge of the artifact classification and dispatch process to post
   the same follow-up comments again and again. Typical examples of
   repeatedly posted comments are: a thank you message to the
   originator, a request for the originator to provide commonly missing
   information like version numbers or type of machine used, etc. Rather
   than typing the same comments all the time, Tuleap allows
   project members to create a predefined set of responses. Each canned
   response is defined by a name and by the body of the response.

   Posting a canned response is just a matter of selecting the
   appropriate response from the pull down menu in the artifact update
   screen and submitting the changes.

File attachments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can attach files to an artifact by using file field.

Please note that it is possible to drag 'n drop (or copy/paste) images
directly in the text or in the follow-up comment field as soon as they
are in ``html`` mode.

Such images will be added in the first updatable file field in the artifact.

Drag 'n drop or copy/paste are not possible if:

* there isn't any file field
* the file field is not updatable (due to permissions) or is frozen (due to workflow)


Artifact Link
-------------

Artifact link field provides a very powerful way to link an artifact to
others. Any artifact from any accessible tracker can be linked to the
current edited artifact. Artifact are displayed as a regular tracker
report where each tab is a list of artifact of a given tracker according
to the default renderer of the default selected report.

Linking artifacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you know the id of artifact you want to link, just add it in the unput box.
You can add several artifact at once, by separating them with comma '1,2'.
If you don't know the id of artifact to add click on the search button, a modal
will allow you to choose artifacts by trackers.

Creating an artifact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As linking another artifacts to a currently edited one, it is possible to
create a artifact in different tracker (e.g. sub-tasks addition) any
created artifact is set as "to be linked", this means that right after
creating it is added to its tracker tab, and in the input field text.

Managing linked artifacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linked or "to be linked" artifacts can be managed in the artifact link
tabs view. Not yet linked artifacts are highlighted. All artifacts can
be uncheck (by clicking the cross).

Using typed artifact links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Tuleap 9.14, trackers use by default the typed artifact links.
This feature gives to the user the ability to add a type to a link between two artifacts.

Trackers and project administrators are able to deactivate the whole feature or some types for the project.
This can be done in the new tracker global administration section

.. figure:: ../../images/screenshots/tracker/global_admin_tracker.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Tracker global administration
   :name: Tracker global administration

Regarding the ``_is_child`` type, it cannot be disabled if a hierarchy exists in the project.
If ``_is_child`` is disabled, a hierarchy cannot be set.

.. attention::

  Some types cannot be disabled because they are used by an active plugin in the project.

Once deactivated:

- A type cannot be used in new links

- Old links using this type still exist

- The type of these links will be cleared after the next artifact update (the link will continue to exist without any type)
