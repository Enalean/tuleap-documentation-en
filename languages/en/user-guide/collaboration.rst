Collaboration
=============

One of the Tuleap objectives is to provide developers with
efficient software development and project management tools. In
addition, the Tuleap site should quickly become the favorite
communication channel of all users as it is pivotal for the project
teams and their community of users to communicate efficiently.

To this end, Tuleap offers a series of communication
services that can be customized by the project team. These include the News service
and the Web Forums.

News Service
------------

The News service complements your mailing lists. This service allows you
to publish pieces of news related to your project. Any event in the life
of your project is a good candidate for a news release: new people in
the team, new software release, information on related technologies and
why not your wedding announcement or the birth of your sixth child ? .
Do not keep your project concealed behind a veil. Make your project life
public for the benefit of all employees and for your faithful community
of users.

News publishing is very easy. Simply click on the "News" item in the
Project Main menu and then on the "Submit" link in the News Service menu
at the top of the page. From there type the title of the news and its
text body. You can type URLs in the body. Tuleap will detect
them and transform them into a hyperlink in the published version. You
can also choose whether you want the news to be public this means
visible on your Project Dashboard for all Tuleap users or
private which means visible for your project members only.

Any Tuleap visitor can attach a follow-up comment to the
news visible for her on your project page making each piece of news a
potential forum of discussion [#f1]_. In addition the Tuleap
Team sees all the public news published by all Tuleap
projects and can decide that a project news is worth publishing on the
Tuleap front page. A big splash indeed!! When submitting a
news, you can request a promotion for the Tuleap front page
to the administrator.

Web Forums
----------

This is the third form of communication offered by Tuleap.
Web Forums are more or less equivalent to mailing list except that the
message-posting takes place via a Web interface rather than email.
Therefore you need to have a connection to the site to participate in
the discussion because you can't prepare your message off-line, as you
can with an ML.

To access the Web Forums of a Tuleap project, click on the
"Forums" item in the Project Main menu. When a Tuleap
project is created, it is given three Web forums: Open Discussions, Help
and Developers. These Forums and all others are open to all
Tuleap users both for reading and posting unless you decide
to make them private (see below). A user can also decide to monitor a
Web Forum. Monitoring a Forum will cause Tuleap to
automatically forward all the posted messages via e- mail thus avoiding
repeated visits to the Forum Web page.

Project administrators can create other Forums on demand by using the
Forum Administration module that can be accessed via the "Admin" link in
the News Service menu. Administrators can follow the links on this page
to Add Forum, Delete Message, and Update Forum Info/Status. The Update
Forum Info/Status page lets administrators make forums public or
private, edit the name and description of the forum, or even delete the
forum.

   Behind the scene, each piece of news is actually managed exactly like
   a Tuleap Web Forum.
