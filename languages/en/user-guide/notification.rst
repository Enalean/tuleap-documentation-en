Notifications in Tuleap
======================

Mail notification in private projects
-------------------------------------
Administrator can choose the way mails are handle in private project.

-  When platform is in "insecure way" mails are sent to users who are explicitly set in services even when they are not project members.

-  When platform is in "secure way" only project members will receive notifications.

Mail notification to several users
----------------------------------

When notification was set manually by the project administrator or by a service administrator (trackers, git...), the mail was sent to the whole list of users, all visible in the "To" field. Now, notifications are sent to each user one by one. People notified don't see each other's email address, mainly for security reason on order to avoid leaking informations.
