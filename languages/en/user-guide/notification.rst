Notifications in Tuleap
======================

Mail notification to several users
----------------------------------

When notification was set manually by the project administrator or by a service administrator (trackers, git...), the mail was sent to the whole list of users, all visible in the "To" field. Now, notifications are sent to each user one by one. People notified don't see each other's email address, mainly for security reason on order to avoid leaking informations.
