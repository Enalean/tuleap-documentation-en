User Registration
-----------------

As suggested above, the first thing to do for newcomers is to create their own account
on Tuleap. Becoming a registered Tuleap user doesn't imply any commitment on your part
to host any of your software projects on Tuleap. It simply gives you more freedom when
you browse the site and allows Tuleap to provide you with personalized information.

Registering on Tuleap is quick and easy:

    1. Select the "New User" link

    2. Give the following information (all items marked with an asterisk are
       mandatory):

        a. **Login Name**: your user name. On some Tuleap systems that
           are connected to an enterprise directory, you may have to use a
           pre-defined user name.

        b. **Password**: 8 characters minimum, type it twice to make sure you
           didn't make any typo

        c. **Full Real Name**: what's your name again?

        d. **E-mail Address**: depending on the site configuration valid email
           addresses may be limited to those in the SYS\_ORG\_NAME domain (or
           SYS\_ORG\_NAME affiliated domains). Make sure your email address is
           correct or you won't receive the registration confirmation message in
           your mailbox and won't be able to complete the registration process.

        e. **Time Zone**: choose the time zone you live in. Choosing the correct
           time zone is really important. Behind the scene Tuleap
           stores all time stamps in GMT time. Choosing the right time zone allow s
           Tuleap to translate all time stamps to your local time on
           the Web pages.

        f. **Site Updates**: check this box if you want to receive site updates
           from the Tuleap Team. This is a low traffic distribution
           list and we strongly advise you to check this box (default). You'll
           receive e-mail from us about the site maintenance, the important event
           in the life of the site, Tuleap presentation/training
           announcement and the Tuleap newsletter.

        g. **Additional Community Mailings**: check this box if you want to receive
           notification about less important events. You can safely check this box
           as well if you want because we seldom use it. So we assure you that you
           won't be overwhelmed with tons of e-mail.

    3. Shortly after you validate the registration form you will receive a
       message in your mailbox which includes a URL. Clicking on this URL will
       bring you to a Tuleap form asking for your login/password
       again. If they match then your account is validated and you are now
       logged into the Tuleap site.

.. NOTE::

    Your Tuleap server might be set up to use an external
    LDAP directory for authentication. In this case, the registration
    phase is even simpler: simply type your LDAP login and password, and
    the system will automatically extract most of the required
    information from the LDAP directory: email address, real name, etc.

This 3 step registration process has been put in place for security
reasons. Assuming people create their account with an alien e-mail
address while they have access to the Intranet, they won't be able to
validate their account from the outside because the Tuleap
machine is behind the firewall. Therefore, an account cannot be
validated from the outside.

.. NOTE::

    Don't panic and, above all, do not create a new account! Go to the
    Tuleap Login Page and click on the [Lost your password?]
    link. You'll be asked your login name and from that
    Tuleap will send you an e-mail message with an embedded
    URL. Click on this URL and give your new password.

    And what if I loose both my login and password? Gee! In this case
    use the search box and, assuming that you gave your full real name
    when you first registered, search for your last name and see if you
    can find your login again in the list of selected users. If so,
    apply the previous procedure. If not then contact us!
