REST API
========

This documentation is still sparse but all end-points are auto-documented. You should be able to access it on your server at '/api/explorer/' URI (the trailing slash is important).

You can also see it in action on https://tuleap.net/api/explorer/

Implementations of the API in various languages are welcomed, please find the list below:

* `Python <https://github.com/djurodrljaca/tuleap-rest-api-client>`_
* `Golang <https://gitlab.com/csgroup-oss/go-tuleap/>`_
* `Shell <https://gitlab.com/csgroup-oss/tuleap-cli>`_ (command line utility)
