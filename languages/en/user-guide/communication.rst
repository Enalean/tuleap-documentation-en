Communication Tools
===================

One of the |SYSPRODUCTNAME| objectives is to provide developers with
efficient software development and project management tools. In
addition, the |SYSPRODUCTNAME| site should quickly become the favorite
communication channel of all users as it is pivotal for the project
teams and their community of users to communicate efficiently.

To this end, |SYSPRODUCTNAME| offers a series of communication
services that can be customized by the project team. These include
mailing lists, the News service, the Web Forums and a Instant Messaging
Plug-in.

.. _mailing-lists:

Mailing Lists
---------------

.. _creation:

Creation
`````````

Each project can create as many mailing lists (ML) as needed. To create
a mailing list click on the "Lists" item in the Project Main menu, then
click on the "Admin" link in the mailing list menu bar.

Adding a ML is just a matter of giving it a name, a one-line
description, and to specify whether it is a public or a private list. A
private list won't show up on the welcome screen of the Mailing List
service and is therefore only known to the project team. This will
prevent other people from subscribing or posting messages to it.

In order to minimize naming conflicts between the many MLs created by
the various |SYSPRODUCTNAME| projects, the mailing list follows the
following naming pattern:

::

    projectname-listname@SYS_LISTS_HOST

Where:

-  ``projectname`` is your project short name as defined during project
   registration.

-  ``listname`` is the name you have chosen for your mailing list.

    **Note**

    Creating a mailing list implies that you are the mailing list
    administrator, at least at the beginning. As the ML administrator,
    you'll receive some additional instructions via e-mail shortly after
    the creation of the ML. This is an important mail message that
    contains the URLs for the ML administration and information pages
    and the default ML administration password generated by
    |SYSPRODUCTNAME|. Keep it in a safe place!

   **Tip**

   A |SYSPRODUCTNAME| hosted project should at least create one
   mailing list (or a web forum) where all users can post questions and
   comments. This list is typically called
   ``projectname-interest@SYS_LISTS_HOST``. We strongly encourage you
   to follow this well established practice.

Administration
```````````````

The ML administration is also entirely Web based. You can access the ML
administration page by using the URL that you received when you first
created the ML. In case you have misplaced the original message you can
access the ML administration page at the following URL:

::

    http://SYS_LISTS_HOST/mailman/admin/listname

The Administration page allows you to tune many ML parameters, manage
list members, and administrators, privacy, new member welcome messages,
etc. GNU/Mailman, the ML manager used by |SYSPRODUCTNAME|, is an
extremely capable software and we invite you to visit the administration
page at least once to get an idea about the feature set.

    **Note**

    Note that project administrators are not automatically made
    administrators of project mailing lists, and the administrative
    password for the mailing list is distinct from any of the other
    |SYSPRODUCTNAME| user passwords.

(Un)Subscription, Archive and Preferences
``````````````````````````````````````````

Unless its owner marks a ML as private, any |SYSPRODUCTNAME| user can
subscribe to a project Mailing List (ML). To subscribe to a mailing list
click on the "Lists" item in the Project Main menu. From there click on
the "Subscribe/Unsubscribe/Preferences" link of the appropriate ML. Then
follow the instructions presented.

The |SYSPRODUCTNAME| ML system (GNU/Mailman) also archives all the
messages posted on a mailing list. Following the "Archive" link on the
same page as before will bring you to archived messages grouped by
month. Note that the current archiving software is not MIME-aware and
does not support the archiving of attachments.

.. _news-service:

News Service
-------------

The News service complements your mailing lists. This service allows you
to publish pieces of news related to your project. Any event in the life
of your project is a good candidate for a news release: new people in
the team, new software release, information on related technologies and
why not your wedding announcement or the birth of your sixth child ? .
Do not keep your project concealed behind a veil. Make your project life
public for the benefit of all employees and for your faithful community
of users.

News publishing is very easy. Simply click on the "News" item in the
Project Main menu and then on the "Submit" link in the News Service menu
at the top of the page. From there type the title of the news and its
text body. You can type URLs in the body. |SYSPRODUCTNAME| will detect
them and transform them into a hyperlink in the published version. You
can also choose whether you want the news to be public this means
visible on your Project Dashboard for all |SYSPRODUCTNAME| users or
private which means visible for your project members only.

Any |SYSPRODUCTNAME| visitor can attach a follow-up comment to the
news visible for her on your project page making each piece of news a
potential forum of discussion [#f1]_. In addition the |SYSPRODUCTNAME|
Team sees all the public news published by all |SYSPRODUCTNAME|
projects and can decide that a project news is worth publishing on the
|SYSPRODUCTNAME| front page. A big splash indeed!! When submitting a
news, you can request a promotion for the |SYSPRODUCTNAME| front page
to the administrator.

Web Forums
-----------

This is the third form of communication offered by |SYSPRODUCTNAME|.
Web Forums are more or less equivalent to mailing list except that the
message-posting takes place via a Web interface rather than email.
Therefore you need to have a connection to the site to participate in
the discussion because you can't prepare your message off-line, as you
can with an ML.

To access the Web Forums of a |SYSPRODUCTNAME| project, click on the
"Forums" item in the Project Main menu. When a |SYSPRODUCTNAME|
project is created, it is given three Web forums: Open Discussions, Help
and Developers. These Forums and all others are open to all
|SYSPRODUCTNAME| users both for reading and posting unless you decide
to make them private (see below). A user can also decide to monitor a
Web Forum. Monitoring a Forum will cause |SYSPRODUCTNAME| to
automatically forward all the posted messages via e- mail thus avoiding
repeated visits to the Forum Web page.

Project administrators can create other Forums on demand by using the
Forum Administration module that can be accessed via the "Admin" link in
the News Service menu. Administrators can follow the links on this page
to Add Forum, Delete Message, and Update Forum Info/Status. The Update
Forum Info/Status page lets administrators make forums public or
private, edit the name and description of the forum, or even delete the
forum.

.. _instant-messaging-plug-in:

Instant Messaging Plug-in
--------------------------

|SYSPRODUCTNAME| is bundled with a Jabber server and an Instant
Messaging (IM) Plug-In that allows a certain level of integration
between them.

If this plug-in is active, an IM account will be automatically available
to each |SYSPRODUCTNAME| user and they will be able to log into the
Jabber server using their |SYSPRODUCTNAME| credentials. Furthermore,
users participating in a project will be grouped together in the Jabber
server, whose will automatically add this group to each of the
participants' roster.

For each project the plug-in will create a multi-user chat room (MUC)
where the members of a project can chat together. Only members of a
project can join its respective MUC, but once a member has joined the
room he or she can invite external users.

The |SYSPRODUCTNAME| IM plug-in comes with a Jabber client integrated
into the web interface of your project. This client lets you chat into
the project MUC Room (see `Multi-User Chat Room (MUC)`_). Of course, each user can choose the client
that best fits his or her needs. Several open source (and/or free)
clients are available for the most common platforms, and you can find a
list (non-exhaustive) of them at http://www.jabber.org/clients. Note
that some clients, like Coccinella for instance, allow you to do shared
whiteboard.

The status of a user using a Jabber client (online, busy, away) is
displayed in |SYSPRODUCTNAME|.

Jabber Related Information on the |SYSPRODUCTNAME| Web Page
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

|SYSPRODUCTNAME| provides several bits of information regarding the
Instant Messaging on its web interface. Thus, each user has access to
his roster (contact list) and the status of each of his contacts
directly on his personal page. In order to do this, simply visit the
page "My Personal Page". If the widget displaying the contact list is
not visible it must be added. To do so, click on the link "Add widgets"
and add the widget corresponding to "My IM Roster".

Next to each user name |SYSPRODUCTNAME| displays a colored icon (gray,
green, yellow or red) that indicates the status of the user: gray for
"offline", green for "online", yellow for "away", and red for "busy".
Users can change their status through their Jabber client.

Any new approved project implies the creation of a corresponding shared
group and chat room.

Any new member added to the project is also added to the corresponding
shared group and chat room. This new member will be automatically
invited to join the project's chat room as soon as he or she connects to
the Jabber server.

If a member is removed from a project then he or she will also be
removed from its corresponding shared group and chat room.

If a project is suspended or awaiting validation, its corresponding chat
room will be made unavailable (locked) and the shared group will not be
visible on the roster of project members.

If a project is deleted, the corresponding chat room and shared group
will be destroyed as well.

Jabber Client Configuration
````````````````````````````

Configuring a Jabber client to use your |SYSPRODUCTNAME| account is
straightforward. In case you are using a multi protocol client the first
thing you need to do is setting the communication protocol to Jabber (or
XMPP). Three other pieces of information are essential for connecting to
your Jabber account: your username, your password, and the address of
the Jabber server you will connect to. Some Jabber clients refer to the
JID (or Jabber ID) which is simply your username and the Jabber server
address connected by a @ sign (eg. username@jabberhost.com), others ask
explicitly for your username and the Jabber server address. You can find
your JID at your personal area on the |SYSPRODUCTNAME| web page by
logging into |SYSPRODUCTNAME| and clicking on the link “Account
Maintenance” on the tab “My Personal Page”, or simply by accessing your
“Developer Profile”. There you can find your “Instant Messaging Login”,
which is formed by your |SYSPRODUCTNAME| username and the
|SYSPRODUCTNAME| Jabber server address. Use the same password you use
to sign in to your |SYSPRODUCTNAME| account.

In addition to these parameters the client may ask you a name for the
resource you are using to connect to your Jabber account. This is handy
when you are connected to the same Jabber account through different
devices and so, for example, a message can be delivered to
you@yourhost.com/pda instead of you@yourhost.com/office (in this case
“pda” and “office” are the resources). You can fill it with any
alpha-numeric string.

Finally, the client needs to know the port number the Jabber server is
listening to. The default value for this parameter is 5222, and most of
the Jabber clients use it by default.

Some other “advanced” parameters can be configured, but it is out of the
scope of this guide to talk about them, so please refer to your Jabber
client documentation for further information on this topic.

Multi-User Chat Room (MUC)
```````````````````````````

As stated before, the IM plug-in creates a multi-user chat room for each
project. This room is named after the project name and is opened only
for project members.

You can access the MUC Room in the web interface of your project, or
with a IM client.

MUC Room with the web interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enter the chat room of your project, you just need to clic on the IM
tab of your project. This will automatically connect you to IM, and you
will be able to start chating with the other connected members.

The web interface of the chat room is composed of several areas:

-  The main window shows you the messages of all participants. The names
   of the participants are written beside the messages, to let you
   better follow the discussion. The system messages (like who arrived
   in the room, who left) are displayed in bold.

   Messages are displayed without specific format, but you can add some
   if you want (see :ref:`Formatting and special commands <formatting-and-special-commands>` for that). 
   URLs are displayed as hyperlinks (and are opened in another window). Project references are also displayed
   as hyperlinks (for instance, if you write the message bug #23 in the
   chat room, a click on the word 'bug #23' will open a new window and
   will lead you to the bug details page). The system does not check
   that bug 23 really exist in your project. it is possible to make
   references to other projects, but only with the pattern keyword
   #projectID:itemNumber. The pattern with project name is not
   recognized by IM. For more details about cross-references, see :ref:`reference-overview`.

-  Just below the main window, is the writing message area. To send a
   message to all chat room members, select this area with the mouse,
   write your message, and then either click on the 'Send' button,
   either press the 'Enter' key. Your message will show up in the flow,
   preceed by your name.

-  The area on the right is the list of the room members, which means
   the users connected to the chat room. This list is updated in real
   time.

   There is a concept of private messages. If you want to talk to
   someone, but don't want the other to see it, you can click on the
   name of the person, and then write your message (the name of the user
   is now just below your message, which indicate he will be the only
   one to receive it). To come back to the usual way of doing (chat with
   eveybody) you just need to click again on the name of the person in
   the writing area, which will make the buddy name disappear.

-  Above the main area, the name of the chat room is written (it is the
   name of the project, you can not change it). Just below, you can find
   the topic of the room. You can update this topic by writing the
   special command as a message:

   ::

       /topic The new topic of the room
                           

-  Below the writing area is located a status zone, corresponding to
   your IM status. This status can be useful to tell the other if your
   are free to chat, or busy, etc. You can also add a free text, to
   express your mood of the day, or anything else!

   On the right, there is a small icon which lets you switch off/ swith
   on the sound. You need a Flash plugin in your browser to have sound.

    **Tip**
    
    .. _formatting-and-special-commands:

    **Formatting and special commands:**

    When you type some text in the chat window, the client interprets
    some commands to format the text. These commands can be interpreted
    depending on the IM client, but most of them are working the same
    way.

    -  **Write in bold:** you must surround your text with a star.

       Example: I will call you \*tomorrow at 2 o'clock\*

    -  **Underlign:** you must surround the text with underscore.

       Example: I will call you \_tomorrow at 2 o'clock\_

    -  **Write a hyperlink:** the system will detect hyperlinks if they
       are starting with http://

       Example : You can read http://tuleap.net and see what I mean

    -  **Make a cross-reference to a item of your project:** You can
       make a reference to any item of your project (artifact, bug,
       document, wiki page, etc.) For that, just write the reference to
       the item respecting the pattern keyword #itemnumber

       Example : You can read the document doc #185 for more details.

    -  **Change the chat room topic:** you must write the specific
       command /topic followed by the new name of the topic.

       Example: /topic Monthly Meeting

    -  **Change your nickname:** You can change your nickname during the
       session. The other users will then see you as this new name. This
       feature can seem funny, but remember that the the discussion will
       be hard to follow if everybody change his nickname often. We
       recommand you to use this feature if it makes sens only (to
       differenciate two people with a close name for instance). Please
       note that nickname changes won't appear in chat room logs.
       Messages will always be alloted to their real user. To change the
       nickname, the command is /nick followed by your new nickname.

       Example: /nick Tom - at home

    -  **Smileys:** You can use smileys. The web client doesn't have an
       interface to insert smileys, but you can add them in a textual
       way. They will appear like an image for the clients (even for the
       web one). Each client implements its own smileys, so use the more
       commons ones, and you shouldn't have any problem.

       Example: the text :-) will display a beautiful smile!

Join a MUC Room with a client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to inform your Jabber client the address of the conference
server it must query for chat rooms. This address is simply
conference.server\_address, i.e. the word “conference”, a dot, and the
Jabber server address. Then you will be able to retrieve the list of
available chat rooms on the server. Just find the chat room
corresponding to your project and join it.

Of course the steps described above are very generic, and each Jabber
client has its own specific process. Please check your Jabber client
documentation for further information about its support on multi-user
chat (group chat, conferences, or simply chat rooms).

Once inside the room you can invite non-members to join it. Once the
user accepts the invitation he or she becomes member of the chat room.

For further information on how to invite external users to chat rooms
using your Jabber client please refer to its documentation.

MUC Room Logs
```````````````

Conversations in chat rooms are logged (private conversation are not).
To access the log, select the link 'Logs' in the IM tab of your project.
Every member of the project has access to the project room logs.

By default, conversation logs of the 7 last days are displayed. You can
of course change the search period, thanks to the calendar. If you don't
want to specify dates, leave the field blank. Blank for start date means
"from the beginning", blank for end date means "until now".

Conversation logs are grouped by day. You will find the time of the
message (hour and minute), the author of the message (username on the
|SYSPRODUCTNAME| server), and of course the message itself. Nickname
changes are not logged. System messages are present. This is very useful
to know who was in the room when what thing has been told. URLs and
cross-references will appear as hyperlinks, but special commands 
(see :ref:`Formatting and special commands <formatting-and-special-commands>`)
won't be interpreted.

A light horizontal line will separate conversations. Two conversations
are considered as different if there has been no activity during at
least 10 minutes.

You can export the room logs, in CSV format. To do this, click on the
Export button at the end of the logs. The export will use your user
preferences for CSV separator and date format (see :ref:`preferences`).

.. [#f1]
   Behind the scene, each piece of news is actually managed exactly like
   a |SYSPRODUCTNAME| Web Forum.
