Artifact List Sorting
======================

By default, artifacts are sorted by the chronological order of the
submission on the Tuleap.

The list of artifacts can be sorted by any of the columns displayed on
the screen by clicking on the column heading. Clicking twice on the same
heading toggles the sort order between ascending to descending. The
currently displayed sorting direction is shown by a small up or down
arrow next to the sort criteria right above the artifact list.

For more sophisticated sorting you can also use the multi-column sort.
In this mode sort criteria accumulates as you click on column headings.
So you can for instance click "Severity" first and "Assigned To" second
to see who in the team is assigned critical bugs and how many.At any
point in the multi-column sort process, a click on one of the sort
criteria displayed in the list (criteria 1 > criteria 2 > criteria 3...)
will bring you backward in the sort criteria list. Using this feature
you can easily test various sorting strategies.
