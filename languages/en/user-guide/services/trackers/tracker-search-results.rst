=======================
Tracker Search Results
=======================

::

  MyTuleapProject > Trackers > MyTracker

Based on your selection of search criteria, Tuleap runs a
query against the tracker database, selects the matching artifacts, and
displays them right below the selection criteria. Columns displayed in
the artifact list are entirely configurable by the user. (see :doc:`tracker-search-results/tracker-report-management`).

Results are listed by chunks of N artifacts where N is user-definable.
If more than N artifacts are retrieved from the tracker database you are
invited to click on the navigation bar to display the next or previous
chunk of artifacts.

To access a given artifact from the list of results, simply click on the icon or on the id.
