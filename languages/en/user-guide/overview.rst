Tuleap Overview
===============

The Tuleap main menu is a permanent piece of information
that you'll always see on your screen wherever you are in the
Tuleap site. Its content can vary according to where and
who you are. In other words it is context sensitive. Let's take 2
examples:

-  If you are visiting the Tuleap site as an anonymous user
   the upper part of the menu invites you to login or to create a new
   account whereas if you are logged in you'll be given access to other
   functions like Logout, Account Maintenance, Personal Page, etc.

-  Similarly if you decide to visit a given project hosted on
   Tuleap, the menu at the top of the screen will also show
   you the list of services available for this project.

In the rest of this section we only review those items that are
permanent and context independent. Other menu items are described later
in the document in the related service description.

Software map will allow you to categorize your project in categories.
For instance Tuleap comes with a Licence > Open source Approved License category.

Search area
```````````

Tuleap allows you to search almost any piece of
Tuleap information through a keyword search mechanism. When
you are on the Tuleap Home Page you can search for keywords
in the following resources:

-  **Software Projects**: a match is attempted with project names as
   well as their short and long description. This search mechanism is
   very complementary with the Software Map (see `Software Map (or Project Tree)`_). Notice that a
   private project will never appear as a search result.

-  **People**: keywords will be searched in the Tuleap user
   database and matched against the user's login name, real name and
   e-mail address.

-  **Wiki**: Wiki is a collaborative authoring tool (see :ref:`wiki`). You can
   perform a full text search by keywords in wikis.

-  **This tracker**: If you enter any tracker in any Tuleap
   project, the "This Tracker" item will show up in the search box,
   allowing you to actually search this tracker database.
