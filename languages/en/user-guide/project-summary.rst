Project Dashboard
=================

The Project Dashboard is the entry point of a Tuleap hosted
project. And, for any project, it is the only page you need to know
about. From this page both ordinary registered users and project
members/administrators can access all project resources and services.
Unlike the Project Administration page (see :ref:`an-example-of-project-dashboard` ), the Project Dashboard is
public and can be visited by any Tuleap user including
anonymous ones. In some sense the Project Dashboard displays the public
face of a project.

Accessing a Project Dashboard
-----------------------------

For project members, accessing the Project Dashboard of one of their
projects is pretty easy: go to your Personal Page and click on the
appropriate project name.

For registered users there are several ways by which you can access the
Project Dashboard of a Tuleap hosted project:

You can use the search box and look for a project name that you know of

You can explore the Software Map if you know where the project is

You can click on the Project name if it appears on the
Tuleap Site statistics on the right hand side of the
Tuleap home page

And finally you can type the Web URL to access the project page. All
projects can be accessed at:

::

    http://tuleap.example.com/projects/short_project_name

If your are thinking of visiting the Project Dashboard of a project on a
regular basis we strongly advise you to bookmark it in your Personal
Page the first time you access the page by using the "Bookmark This
Page" link in the Tuleap Main Menu. (see :ref:`login-and-personal-page`)

    **Tip**

    The Project Home Page is not the same as the Project Dashboard. The
    Project Dashboard is a real-time overview of the project progress
    and activities but it is not a substitute for a real Web Site where
    you describe what the project is about, related links and resources,
    etc. Tuleap also offers a Web Site to each project. The
    "Home Page" item in the Project Main Menu is precisely a pointer to
    this Web Site (see :ref:`project-web-site` for more information on your Project Web Site
    and how to use it).

Project Dashboard Content
-------------------------

A sample Project Dashboard is available in :ref:`an-example-of-project-dashboard`. The page is split in
several areas:

-  **Project Main Menu**: is a recap of all the services available for a
   given project. As you browse the various services and resources of a
   given project this menu will always be visible.

-  **Short Description and Categorization**: already described before.
   Next to the short description is a pointer to a longer description
   and to additional information provided by the creator of the project.

-  **Project members and Administrators**: are listed in the upper right
   corner of the page. A click on a name will direct you to the user
   page where you can learn more about the Tuleap user and
   send him/her an e-mail.

-  **A customizeable zone** (see below).

Tuleap allows project admins to personalize the Project
Dashboard. The content of the page is made of *widgets*. All widgets can
be moved, collapsed or closed. Some of them can provide an rss feed or
preferences can be set.

Other users than project admins will see the corresponding static page.
The widgets will be the same, in the same position, but they won't be
able to modify the page.

New widgets can be added through the link "Add widgets". Here is an
incomplete list of available widgets for the project dashboard:

-  **Public Areas**: this is an iconic list of all available services
   for this project along with some information next to it. Click on any
   of this item to access a service. The role of this area is pretty
   much equivalent to the Project Main Menu at the top of the screen
   except that it shows additional information about each of the service
   (e.g. total number of open bugs, tasks, ...)

-  **Latest News**: the last 10 pieces of news posted by the project
   members. Some of this news might also be visible on the
   Tuleap front page if the Tuleap Team decided
   that it was worth a site announcement.

-  **Latest File Release**: show the list of most recent packages
   available for download along with their revision. A Release Notes
   icon (|image1|) allows you to see the latest changes and developers
   comments associated with this revision. Then comes the monitor icon
   (|image2|). Selecting this icon will cause this package to be
   monitored for you. Anytime the project development team posts a new
   release, you will be automatically notified via e-mail. All monitored
   File Releases are listed in your Personal Page and can be canceled
   from this page or from the main page of the file release system.

-  **RSS Reader** allows project admins to include public rss (or atom)
   feeds. For example the reader can display a feed published by
   external tools used by the project (like continuous integration).
