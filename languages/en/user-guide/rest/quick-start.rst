Quick Start
===========

In this quick start, we will use the following use case:

* Authenticate against the Tuleap server
* Formulate a query to return the artifacts that match my search criteria
* Modify the field that needs to be updated

This only targets trackers, but will cover the basis of Tuleap REST API and
will serve as an example for other API routes.
