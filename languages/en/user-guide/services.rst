.. attention::

  This section is quite new. It has been added in an effort to revamp the documentation
  of Tuleap in an more accurate, more up-to-date, and more sensible way. It might
  be incomplete or not on-par with the current/old documentation, but it strives to
  become the reference. If you can find the information you are looking for here,
  definitely take it from here and not from the old documentation.

A Tuleap project is composed of a collection of **Services** that are used to collaborate.
From **Trackers** to **Git** through **Documentation**, here is a list of Services
you can activate for your project and their associated documentation, both for using
and administrating them.
