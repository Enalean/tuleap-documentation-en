Mediawiki
=========

Overview
--------

This chapter is not a Mediawiki Tutorial. It focuses on the integration of Mediawiki
with Tuleap. If you are not familiar with Mediawiki we warmly advise you to first
read some of the documents listed in the references section (see `Mediawiki References`_).

The Mediawiki version provided by Tuleap is 1.20. As of today, this Mediawiki has no plugin
deployed.

There is one instance of Mediawiki per project. Tuleap manages the connection to Mediawiki.
A Tuleap user has access to the Mediawiki service in any project he is able to access (and which has activated the service),
so you don't need to register on Mediawiki.

Restricted users will have access to Mediawiki from projects they are members of.
If they aren't, they won't be able to access Mediawiki from public or private projects.

Permissions
-----------

Note for long time Mediawiki users. Contrary of default Mediawiki, in Tuleap 'anonymous' can only Read pages (they cannot create nor edit).

As of today, when you have a public Tuleap project, you cannot block anonymous users to browse the pages.

Shall you need to have a private Mediawiki, you should switch your project to Private.

Mapping between Tuleap and Mediawiki user groups
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

There is a default mapping between Tuleap and Mediawiki default user groups.

Users added in Tuleap groups will be automatically added in corresponding Mediawiki groups. It is no more possible
to add users in Mediawiki groups directly from Mediawiki.

For instance, by adding a user in your project, he will be added in user, autoconfirmed and emailconfirmed Mediawiki groups.
This is fully transparent for users and project adminstrators. As of today, there is no way to create a
custom mapping from the Mediawiki service.

This default mapping is defined as above:

.. figure:: ../images/screenshots/mediawiki_mapping.png
   	   :align: center
  	   :alt: Mediawiki groups mapping
  	   :name: Mediawiki groups mapping

As a project admin you can also define your own mapping between Tuleap and Mediawiki groups.

.. figure:: ../images/screenshots/mediawiki_admin_mapping.png
   	   :align: center
  	   :alt: Mediawiki groups mapping administration
  	   :name: Mediawiki groups mapping administration

Please note that it's not possible to assign Tuleap special 'all_users' and 'registered_users' to Mediawiki groups.

Synchronisation for Mediawiki users and groups
```````````````````````````````````````````````

In order to have fully relevant users and groups in Mediawiki, the synchronisation
is launched when the following actions occured:

-  Tuleap user is removed from project member

-  Tuleap user is no more administrator of the project

-  Tuleap user is renamed


Compatibility view
------------------
In order to accommodate for mediawiki plugins that are not compatible with Tuleap's window rendering there is an option to enable
a compatibility view. If checked and if the site administrators have set it up then the mediawiki in that project will take a standalone
appearance. There will be links on the sidebar that will bring you back to your project area.
