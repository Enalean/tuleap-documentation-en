Document Manager
================

Documentation is probably the second most important deliverable in a
software project after the software work products themselves.
Tuleap provides a specific service to manage your project
documents.

Although the Tuleap Document Manager cannot be compared with
dedicated document management systems, it is however very handy to
publish documents that are critical to your community of users. Examples
are: Installation, Administration or User Guide, API documentation,
Frequently Asked Questions, etc...

The Document Manager features are as follows:

-  The Tuleap Document Manager can handle any type of
   document.
-  Documents are stored in folders. You can have subfolders in a folder.
-  Documents can be edited online (See `Embedded files`_ and :ref:`ONLYOFFICE integration <onlyoffice-integration>`).
-  Access control rules can be defined for each document or folder.
-  Documents have properties and searchable properties.

Managers   Managers are writers who can also set permissions on a document

.. _document-download-folder-zip:

Download a folder as a zip archive
``````````````````````````````````

.. figure:: ../../images/screenshots/document/folder_download_zip.png
  :alt: Screenshot of the "Download a folder as zip" dropdown menu item

  Download as zip is available on all folders

You can download folders as a zip archive. Every sub-folder, file and embedded
file in this folder will be downloaded as a zip archive. Embedded files are
saved as HTML files. The zip archive is made of the last version of the files.

Please note that, even if the file is a ``.zip`` there is actually no
compression of the files. The ``.zip`` is used to create an archive that
can be downloaded but the server won't compress the files within because
it would be too heavy to manage for the Tuleap server.

Downloading a folder as a zip archive is subjected to :ref:`size limitations<site-admin-document>`
that can be enforced by your site administrator. By default, users may not
download folders with a size above 2 Gigabytes (GB).

.. attention::

  If Tuleap encounters a problem while processing one of the files (the file is
  corrupted, not found, not readable or Tuleap has not enough memory), it will
  add a file named ``TULEAP_ERRORS.txt`` at the root of the zip archive. This
  file will list all files with issues that could not be downloaded. If it
  happens, please let your site administrator know.

.. warning::

  For Mac OS X users, there is a special limitation: if the folder has a size
  above 4 Gigabytes (GB) or contains more than 64000 files, the native Mac OS
  archive extraction tool might not be able to open the archive. Tuleap will
  warn you if you encounter this case.

Delete
``````

Documents or folders can be deleted. If the user wants to delete a
folder, he will be warned that all subitems will be deleted (if the user
has enough permissions).

To be able to delete an item, the user must have write permissions on
the parent folder.

Administration

Search
``````

Configure the available criteria and columns displayed in the search page.
By default every properties are used as criteria and columns.
