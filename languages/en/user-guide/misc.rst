Search area
===========

Tuleap allows you to search almost any piece of
Tuleap information through a keyword search mechanism. When
you are on the Tuleap Home Page you can search for keywords
in the following resources:

-  **Software Projects**: a match is attempted with project names as
   well as their short and long description. This search mechanism is
   very complementary with the Software Map. Notice that a
   private project will never appear as a search result.

-  **People**: keywords will be searched in the Tuleap user
   database and matched against the user's login name, real name and
   e-mail address.

-  **Wiki**: Wiki is a collaborative authoring tool (see :ref:`wiki`). You can
   perform a full text search by keywords in wikis.

-  **This tracker**: If you enter any tracker in any Tuleap
   project, the "This Tracker" item will show up in the search box,
   allowing you to actually search this tracker database.
