Project Web Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. danger:: Enabling this feature **has major security consequences**, as such the feature is disabled by default.
   It is strongly advised to leave it disabled.

When a project is registered on Tuleap a new web site is created for that project. A default home page is installed for that project from the ``/usr/share/tuleap/site-content/en_US/others/default_page.php`` file. You may want to create your own custom file for your own Tuleap site. To do so, copy the ``/usr/share/tuleap/site-content/en_US/others/default_page.php`` file in the ``/etc/tuleap/site-content/en_US/others/`` directory if not already there. Then, edit the custom file and customize it to your liking
