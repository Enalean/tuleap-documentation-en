MediaWiki
=========

As a site administrator you should be aware that

* Tuleap relies on an external MediaWiki package wrapped with a Tuleap Skin. We run unmodified MediaWiki code.
* Some extensions are bundled see :ref:`Mediawiki section in User Guide <mediawiki>` and there is no possibilities for administrators to add additional ones.

Upgrade to the MediaWiki Standalone plugin
------------------------------------------

It is possible to upgrade projects from the legacy MediaWiki plugin to the current MediaWiki Standalone plugin.
To do so, as a site administrator, go to site administration. In the "MediaWiki Standalone" section you have the
ability to migrate projects. The migration process is one-way and cannot be rollbacked.
