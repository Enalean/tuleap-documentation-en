  You can set limits on the maximum total size of the Zip archive that users may
  download. All limits are set in Megabytes (MB).

Both limits apply in the Document manager for :ref:`downloading a folder as a zip<document-download-folder-zip>`.
The first limit **forbids** users from downloading folders above this size. The
second limit shows a warning to users but still allows downloading folders
above this size.
