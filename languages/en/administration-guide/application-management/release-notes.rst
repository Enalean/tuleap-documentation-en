Release Notes
=============

Case 1: Tuleap provides easy access to the end-user to the Tuleap official release notes

When your Tuleap server is updated, the URL to the Tuleap official release notes is automatically
up to date.
and your users are informed with a star  in the Help dropdown at the bottom right.
You have nothing to do.

Case 2: You want to update the release notes URL provided

Go to the platform administration and click on "Release note link".
You will be able to edit the release note link.

Case 3: You do not want to use the official Tuleap release notes

You will need your own web page to present the release notes. And follow
Case 2 each time you upgrade.
