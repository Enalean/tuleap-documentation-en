Graylog
-------

System administrators can configure Tuleap to send logs in a centralized `Graylog <https://www.graylog.org/>`_ server
or, for what is worth, anything that can ingest `gelf <https://www.graylog.org/features/gelf>`_ messages.

The server can be configured with variables (to be set with ``tuleap config-set`` in CLI):

* ``graylog2_server``: the graylog server fully qualified name without port or protocol (eg `logs.example.com`)
* ``graylog2_port``: graylog server port (eg `5789`)
* ``graylog2_ssl``: set to `1` if you want the connection to be encrypted. You might need to add graylog server certificate into the :ref:`trusted certificates <admin_howto_add_certicate>`.
* ``graylog2_debug``: set to `1` if you want to raise errors about communication to graylog server (those logs will be found in nginx or fpm logs).

.. NOTE::

    Tuleap can only send logs using TCP and Gelf as of today. On Graylog side of the configuration, you need to create an
    input accordingly (TCP/Gelf).

Once everything is set, you can switch the logs to graylog with

.. sourcecode:: shell

    $> tuleap config-set sys_logger graylog2

Syslog
------

System administrators can also decide to send all Tuleap application logs to syslog. Most of the time, this should be used
in conjunction with a centralized logging with ``journald``, ``rsyslog`` or ``syslog-ng``.

To activate it run:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    $> tuleap config-set sys_logger syslog

You will find the logs with ``journalctl -t tuleap`` on RHEL7+ or ``/var/log/messages`` on RHEL6.
