Backup/Restore
**************

This documentation is here to help you set up your backup. Be careful with this, it's just a guide and you will probably want to backup more things.

If you installed Tuleap on a virtual environment and you are able to use snapshots, the simplest backup solution is to suspend tuleap services and then make a snapshot.

Otherwise here are some tips to backup and restore your Tuleap infrastructure.

Backup for RPM Deployment on RHEL/Alma/Rocky
============================================

Suspend services
----------------

Depending on services you use, you will want to stop them before the backup (It should guarantee you a consistent backup):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ systemctl stop nginx
    $ systemctl stop httpd
    $ systemctl stop tuleap
    $ su - gitolite -c "gitolite writable @all off 'Backup in progress'"

Don't forget to restart services once the backup is done.

Database backup
---------------

Tuleap main database is ``tuleap``, but additionnal databases can be used for plugins. To show them use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mysql -u codendiadm -p -e "show databases;"

You can write a script to backup each database independently or use ``mysqldump`` to backup all databases:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mysqldump -u codendiadm -p --all-databases > mybackup.sql

.. _tuleap_data_paths:

Tuleap data paths backup
------------------------

You need to save the following directories:

  - /etc/nginx
  - /etc/valkey
  - /etc/tuleap
  - /var/lib/gitolite
  - /var/lib/tuleap

Some directories might not exist depending on your configuration (plugins installed or not).

Backup for Docker/Compose Deployment
====================================

Suspend services
----------------

Depending on the services you use, you will want to stop them before the process, it should guarantee you a consistent backup:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /path_to/tuleap_compose
    $ docker compose stop tuleap

Don't forget to restart services once the backup is done.

Database backup
---------------

Tuleap main database is ``tuleap``, but additionnal databases can be used for plugins. To show them, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker exec SQL_CONTAINER /usr/bin/mysql -u codendiadm -p -e "show databases;"

You can write a script to backup each database independently or use ``mysqldump`` to backup all databases:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Backup
    docker exec SQL_CONTAINER /usr/bin/mysqldump -u codendiadm -p --all-databases > sqldump_all_tuleap.sql

    # Restore (use root user for an empty server)
    cat sqldump_all_tuleap.sql | docker exec -i SQL_CONTAINER /usr/bin/mysql -u root -p

Tuleap docker data paths
------------------------

For a docker deployment, all data is stored in ``/data`` directory mapped from the container: backup all its content from the docker host.

Restore Tuleap
==============

As only data were backed up, you first need a Tuleap server to restore them. It can be your old server or a new server you have just installed following the installation guide. Then you will need to:

  - suspend all services
  - restore databases (from a sqldump is the safest method to ensure compatibility between instances)
  - restore directories (you must remap uids/gids if restoring from a RPM instance: see below)
  - run the site-deploy tool ``tuleap-cfg site-deploy``
  - restart services

Restoration from RPM Deployment on RHEL/Alma/Rocky
==================================================

uids/gids
---------

If you plan to **restore a backup from an RPM instance** to a new one (RPM or Docker), its likely that linux user and group **ids have changed** in between.

First you need to **identify the old ids** from your backup archive or your old instance, looking for each of those files (that should be owned by) :

  - /etc/tuleap/conf/encryption_secret.key (codendiadm)
  - /var/lib/gitolite/.gitolite/conf/gitolite.conf (gitolite)
  - /var/lib/tuleap/ftp/pub (ftpadmin)


Example use of ``ls -ldn`` to display those ids

.. code-block:: bash

    [root@tuleap ~]# ls -ldn /etc/tuleap/conf/encryption_secret.key /var/lib/gitolite/.gitolite/conf/gitolite.conf /var/lib/tuleap/ftp/pub
    -r--------  1 980 980   64 Aug 16  2018 /etc/tuleap/conf/encryption_secret.key
    -rw-rw----  1 976 976  867 Dec 21  2020 /var/lib/gitolite/.gitolite/conf/gitolite.conf
    drwxr-xr-x 22 979 978 4096 Oct 22 08:59 /var/lib/tuleap/ftp/pub

Then **construct the maps** from the 3rd (uid) and 4th (gid) columns and the associated owner name
  - usermap: ``980:codendiadm,976:gitolite,979:ftpadmin``
  - groupmap: ``980:codendiadm,976:gitolite,978:ftpadmin``

As you can see, for ftpadmin uids and gids are not the same in this example.

Migrate/Restore to Docker
=========================

If you plan to **migrate RPM to docker**, you must use the following numerical ids as the users won't be created on the docker host:
  - codendiadm: 900
  - gitolite: 902
  - ftpadmin: 904

So the maps will be ``--usermap=980:900,976:902,979:904`` and ``--groupmap=980:900,976:902,978:904`` for a docker target in this exemple.

If you are only **restoring a docker** instance **onto a docker** instance, those ids should already be set and a **remap is not necessary**.

Remap uids with rsync
=====================

Finally you can use a tool like ``rsync`` to help you remap your data while restoring/resyncing:

.. code-block::

    rsync [OPTION...] --usermap=980:codendiadm,976:gitolite,979:ftpadmin \
                      --groupmap=980:codendiadm,976:gitolite,978:ftpadmin \
                      SRC... [DEST]

Moving Tuleap folders to an external disk
=========================================

For the mentioned :ref:`tuleap data paths <tuleap_data_paths>`, you could move them on a **separate data disk** for easier backup.

Like for the "Restore Tuleap" process decribed before, you need a running tuleap instance for the users/uids/gids to be created.

Then, after suspending **all services including mysql** (if you want mysql to be on a data disk too) :
  - move each directory to its new location, example: ``mv /etc/nginx /data/etc_nginx``
  - then at your convenience:
     * create symbolic links for each directory, example: ``ln -s /data/etc_nginx /etc/nginx``
     * or use bind mounts through ``/etc/fstab`` like below (you need to ``mount`` them after updating the file)
  - you can then restart services

Example of bind mounts via local fstab

.. code-block:: bash

    /data/etc_nginx /etc/nginx none bind,nofail 0 0
    /data/etc_valkey /etc/valkey none bind,nofail 0 0
    /data/etc_tuleap /etc/tuleap none bind,nofail 0 0
    /data/var_lib_gitolite /var/lib/gitolite none bind,nofail 0 0
    /data/var_lib_mysql /var/lib/mysql none bind,nofail 0 0
    /data/var_lib_tuleap /var/lib/tuleap none bind,nofail 0 0
