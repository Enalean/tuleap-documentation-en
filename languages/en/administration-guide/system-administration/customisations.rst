Tuleap Customisations
=====================

System configuration files
--------------------------

The PHP scripts take many values from a configuration file located in
``/etc/tuleap/conf/local.inc``. Make sure that you read this file where the role
of each variable is well documented.

Database configuration is read from ``/etc/tuleap/conf/database.inc``.

The file ``/etc/tuleap/conf/encryption_secret.key`` is used by Tuleap when data
need to be encrypted. It is generated by Tuleap the first time it is needed.
If this file is lost or altered, any encrypted data are not recoverable.

Plugins specific configuration can be found in the folder ``/etc/tuleap/plugins/``.

Organization Logo
-----------------

At the top of the left hand side Tuleap menu pane (just above the Logged In section) is an empty area where you can dock the logo of your organization. This can be achieved by putting your nice logos in ``/var/lib/tuleap/images``:

This is how Tuleap displays the logo :

    - browser width > 1366px: ``organization_logo.png`` (recommended size: 200x45px)
    - browser width < 1300px: ``organization_logo_small.png`` (recommended size: 45x45px)
    - in emails: ``organization_logo_mail.png`` (recommended size: 97x42px)

Background colour: you need to add a background to your image if you want another background colour than the navbar colour. Note: the Tuleap FlamingParrot theme has multiple colour variants.

Site content
------------

Several PHP scripts in the source code contain pieces of text or code that are generally here to give instructions to the users or to provide site-specific information. Typical examples are: the introductory text at the top of the home page, instructions on how to connect to the SVN repository, instructions and guidelines in the project registration process, LDAP repository information, etc.

These pieces of text or code are isolated from the PHP scripts themselves and they are all placed under the top directory 'site-content'. The file path to the content of a given script (or part of a script) follows the following pattern:

``site-content/LANG_COUNTRY/src_path/sometext.txt``

where:

    LANG_COUNTRY is the standard ISO naming for language and countries: either en_US or fr_FR.
    src_path is the name of the directory under src which contains the script the text belongs to.
    sometext.txt is a file name that contains the piece of text itself.

To customise the content of a given script for your site go through the following steps:
    - under /etc/tuleap create the site-content directory if it doesn't exist.

For each piece of text that you want to customize, copy the original sometext.txt file under the ``/etc/tuleap/site-content/``
with the exact same path. For instance if you want to customise the introductory text of the home page,
copy ``/usr/share/tuleap/site-content/en_US/homepage/welcome_intro.txt`` into ``/etc/site-content/en_US/homepage/welcome_intro.txt``
and edit it as you like.
Be careful that some of these files contain PHP scripting that you probably want to preserve in your customised version.
Deleting the PHP scripting could break the entire PHP scripts.
Ask on the Tuleap devel mailing list if you are unsure of what you are doing.

Read also Localization below for additional information on how to customise interface messages.

Localization
------------

Tuleap source code is localized so the interface is displayed in the user-selected language. Currently, Tuleap supports the English and French languages.

Messages are stored in the site-content directory: there is one message file per service, with the same name as the service, ending with '.tab'. E.g. 'site-content/en_US/tracker/tracker.tab' contains all tracker messages in English.

The format of the message files is very simple: one line per message, with the following format
    key1 tab? key2 tab? your message here

As with other site-content files, you may customize the language files, so that you can change a few specific messages:

    Copy the language file you need to customize from the ``/usr/share/tuleap/site-content`` subdirectory to the corresponding subdirectory in ``/etc/tuleap/site-content`` (see Site content above).
    Remove all lines that you don't need to change and only keep the lines you will modify.
    Change the messages.
    Repeat the operation for all the languages you need to support on your server.

For performance reasons, Tuleap localization is kept in a cache file. When your customisations are finished, run the following command to clear this cache and see your modifications:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tuleap --clear-caches

Localize service names
``````````````````````

If you would like to add new system-wide or project-wide services please
note the following:

For those service names to be localized, we store a simple key for the
service label and description in the database. These keys are then
translated into the users current language by doing a look up of the key
in the site\_content/<*language*>/project/project.tab file.

The keys follow a simple pattern:

-  ``service_<service short name>_lbl_key`` for the service label
-  ``service_<service short name>_desc_key`` for the service description

To assure the correct localization when adding a new service please
follow the instructions below:

-  Choose ``service_<service short name>_lbl_key`` as service label
-  Choose ``service_<service short name>_desc_key`` as service
   description
-  Add two entries into each
   **site\_content/<*language*>/project/project.tab**
   `` project_admin_editservice   service_<service short name>_lbl_key <your localized service label> project_admin_editservice   service_<service short name>_desc_key    <your localized service description>``
