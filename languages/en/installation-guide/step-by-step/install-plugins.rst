Plugins installation
====================

Tuleap comes with a lot of plugins, they bring new features and can be easily installed and configured.

Installing new plugins
----------------------

Installation is done in 2 steps

* First, you need to install the corresponding RPM package
* Then you need to install and activate from the site admin interface

When you want to install a new plugin, run (where ``tuleap-plugin-awesomestuff``
is the name of the package of the plugin you want to install):

.. sourcecode:: shell

    # Deploy RPM package
    dnf install tuleap-plugin-awesomestuff

    # Install and activate the plugin for all projects and users
    sudo -u codendiadm tuleap plugin:install awesomestuff

    # Update configurations
    tuleap-cfg site-deploy
    systemctl reload nginx
    systemctl restart tuleap

Once the plugin is installed, go to Tuleap site admin home page and enter the plugin administration page. You can now
install and activate the new plugin from 'Not yet installed' tab.
