Docker image
============

Why should I use the Docker Image ?
-----------------------------------

The docker image allows you to test Tuleap quickly by skipping the installation and customization part.
It gives you a working tuleap in a few minutes (time it takes to download it) and allows you to test it
and see if it fits your needs.


Requirements
------------

Just install Docker.


Installation
------------

Go to the `Tuleap image <https://hub.docker.com/r/enalean/tuleap-aio/>`_ page in the Docker hub and follow the instructions.

Next steps
----------

Once you have a fully running Tuleap you can start using it: issue tracking, source code management, agile planning and more.
