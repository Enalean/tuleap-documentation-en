Ansible Installation
====================

If you are an ansible user, you can use the ansible role we made to ease your tuleap installation and maintenance.

If you are not an ansible user and care about deployment tools or manage a large scale infrastructure, you probably want to manage your Tuleap server without trouble and ansible could be a solution.

If you plan to have more than one Tuleap server (for testing and production environment), you probably want a unified way to deploy your Tuleap version, ansible can help you with this.
